## Hi there 👋

Hello, I'm Sunshine6153. Thank you for visiting my profile! This space is dedicated to documenting my passion for coding and Japanese ACG (Animation, Comics, and Games) culture.

## 🌸 My Interests & Worldview

###  Deep Interest in ACG Culture

I have a profound interest in Japanese ACG culture, particularly in **Galgame** (dating simulation games). I believe these works are not only entertainment but also carriers of immense creativity, emotion, and exquisite art.

You can find some of my passion projects inspired by this culture in my repositories, such as:

* **RiddleJockerGame**: A small card game built with Python, based on the theme of *Riddle Joker*.
* **Onani_demo**:A little galgame made by ren'py.
* **website**:You can also visit [个人网站]https://tenndouarisu.top
and [妃爱应援网站]https://hiyori.top to find more.

### 💻 Exploring Software Engineering

* **I am not an expert in the software field.** While my professional ability may not be strong, I am deeply passionate about exploring the technical world.
* I strongly believe that **Learning by Doing** is the best way to grow. I enjoy using my interests (like ACG) as a driving force to try out technical projects that I find compelling and fun.
* My code might be rough or a bit unpolished, but I am always happy to share my learning process and the outcomes of my attempts.
